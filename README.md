## Data Structures

In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.

Data structure is a way or a format in which your data is stored in memory for efficient usage and retrieval.

## Algorithms

An algorithm is a set of instructions that are used to accomplish a task, such as finding the largest number in a list, removing all the red cards from a deck of playing cards, sorting a collection of names, or figuring out an average movie rating from just your friends' opinions.

Algorithms are not limited to computers. They are like a set of step-by-step instructions or an even a recipe, containing things you need, steps to do, the order to do them, conditions to look for, and expected results.
